   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend is located in the `server` directory. It handles user authentication, song management, and playlist management.

### Directory Structure

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
